esp32matt.ino works (run this on the anchor esp32), this code will get back the distance values from the other tags YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE SMALL BUTTON ON THE BACK AND THE BOOT BUTTON when it says like UWB Module configured

use matt code (TagSetupForAnthony) i think (ryan did this idk) and run this on each respective tag (change the address)


run rpidifftopics.py on the rpi (returns most recent 5 values from each of the esp32), diff topics for each esp32
-> future steps: use those data for the triangulation calculations
